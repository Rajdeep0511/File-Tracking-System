# File-Tracking-System
The core objective of the File Tracking System is to establish a comprehensive, web
based platform for efficient
document management and tracking. It facilitates end to end document lifecycle management, from initial user
submission to administrative processing and analytical review.
Key capabilities include new document submission, real
time status tracking, and advanced administrative tools for
comprehensive document management and statistical insights.
The application features distinct frontend and backend components, built with a strong emphasis on role
based access
control (RBAC). This ensures that general users (citizens, organizations) have a clear path for document interaction,
while administrators possess elevated privileges for managing the system and its data effectively. The application's
layout is structured with a top level app container , a fixed upper bar for navigation, a flexible dashboard
container that dynamically adjusts to content, and a persistent lower bar at the bottom, ensuring a consistent user
experience across various device sizes.
